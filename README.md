# Learning Journey Showcase
 This repository is a compilation of projects and code examples that showcase my learning journey in web development. It encompasses a range of technologies I have explored, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, ES6, Apache, PHP, MySQL, AJAX, jQuery, Sass, Ionic, and WordPress. Each folder contains projects related to a specific technology, demonstrating my knowledge and skills in each area. Feel free to explore and witness my progress over time.
